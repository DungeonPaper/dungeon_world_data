You'll see it in many mountain towns-a snake sigil scrawled on a tavern wall or a local church burned to the ground. People going missing in the mines. Men and women wearing the mark of the serpent. At the core of it all lies a naga: an old race now fallen into obscurity, still preening with the head of a man over its coiled, serpent body. Variations of these creatures exist depending on their bloodline and original purpose, but they are all master manipulators and magical forces to be reckoned with.",

We could see from the entrance that the area had become full of these creatures-like men with red and orange skin, tall as an ogre but with a snake's tail where their legs ought to be. They were clothed, too-some had black glass armor. They spoke to each other in a tongue that sounded like grease in a fire. I wanted to leave but the sergeant wouldn't listen.
